# flash1dkmeans
An optimized K-means implementation for the one-dimensional case.

Exploits the fact that one-dimensional data can be sorted.

For the lower level functions prefixed with `numba_`, Numba acceleration is used,
so callers can utilize these functions within their own Numba-accelerated functions.

Note that this library is **not an implementation of optimal 1D K-means**, which is known to be possible through dynamic programming approaches and entails $O(n)$ runtime.
Instead, this is a $O(\log{n})$ optimization of the commonly used K-means++ initialization and Lloyd's algorithm - thus it should run faster at the cost of possible non-optimal clusterings - plus a novel optimal two-cluster specific algorithm, which indeed does produce optimal clusterings.

## Important Notice

This library utilizes [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), a JIT compiler, for acceleration.
As there is a compile time overhead, the first invocation may be slower than usual.

Numba caches the compiled functions, so execution times should stabilize after the first invocation.

## Features

### Two clusters

Guaranteed to find the optimal solution for two clusters by employing a clever binary search.  
The algorithm is deterministic.

### K clusters

Uses the K-means++ initialization algorithm to find the initial centroids.
Then uses the Lloyd's algorithm to find the final centroids, except with optimizations for the one-dimensional case.
The algorithm is non-deterministic, but you can provide a random seed for reproducibility.

## Time Complexity

For number of elements $n$, number of clusteres $k$, number of Lloyd's algorithm iterations $i$, and assuming one-dimensional data (which is the only case covered by this implementation):

- **Two clusters**: $O(\log{n})$  
  ($+ O(n)$ for prefix sum calculation if not provided, $+ O(n \cdot \log {n})$ for sorting if not sorted)
- **$k$ clusters**: $O(k ^ 2 \cdot \log {k} \cdot \log {n}) + O(i \cdot \log {n} \cdot k)$  
  (The first term is for K-means++ initialization, and the latter for Lloyd's algorithm)  
  ($+ O(n)$ for prefix sum calculation if not provided, $+ O(n \cdot \log {n})$ for sorting if not sorted)

This is a significant improvement over common K-means implementations.
For example, general implementations for $d$-dimensional data using a combination of greedy K-means++ initialization and Lloyd's algorithm for convergence,
when given one-dimensional data, spends $O(k ^ 2 \cdot \log {k} \cdot n)$ time in initialization and $O(i \cdot n \cdot k)$ time in iterations.

**Note that you must use the underlying `numba_` functions directly in order to directly supply prefix sums and skip sorting.**

## How fast is it?
Here we compare `flash1dkmeans` against one of the most commonly used K-means implementations, [sklearn.cluster.KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html).

In the figures below, we show the K-means clustering runtime on randomly generated data of various sizes.
- **flash1dkmeans** measures the wrapper function kmeans_1d, which includes the sorting and prefix sum calculation overheads.  
- **flash1dkemeans_numba** measures the underlying Numba-accelerated functions, excluding the sorting and prefix sum calculation overheads. (A case where this performance is useful is when you only have to sort once, while calling K-means multiple times on different segments of the same data - or if you already have the sorted prefix sum calculations ready. Both happened to be the case for [Any-Precision-LLM](https://github.com/SNU-ARC/any-precision-llm).)

You can confirm that `flash1dkmeans` is several orders of magnitude faster, even when measured with the wrapper function, including the sorting and prefix sum calculation overheads.
Additionally, you can see that for the two-cluster case, the algorithm indeed is $O(\log{n})$ - the Numba function's runtime barely grows.

These speeds are achieved while finding the <ins>optimal clustering for the two-cluster case</ins>, and running an <ins>optimized but mathematically equivalent algorithm to sklearnâ€™s implementation for the k-cluster case</ins>, ensuring identical or better results apart from numerical errors and effects from randomness.

The figures below demonstrate this by comparing the squared error of the clusterings, on real and generated datasets obtained using scikit-learn.

## Installation
```bash
pip install flash1dkmeans
```

## Usage

### Basic usage
```python
from flash1dkmeans import kmeans_1d

data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]
k = 2

centroids, labels = kmeans_1d(data, k)
```

### More Options
```python
from flash1dkmeans import kmeans_1d
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0])
weights = np.random.random_sample(data.shape)
k = 3

centroids, labels = kmeans_1d(
    data, k,
    sample_weights=weights,  # sample weights
    max_iter=100,  # maximum number of iterations
    random_state=42,  # random seed
)
```

### Even More Options
The underlying Numba-accelerated function `numba_kmeans_1d_k_clusters` can be used directly for more control.

This is useful when the algorithm is run multiple times on different segments of the data,
or to use within another Numba-accelerated function.

The list of available functions are as follows:
- `numba_kmeans_1d_two_clusters`
- `numba_kmeans_1d_two_clusters_unweighted`
- `numba_kmeans_1d_k_cluster`
- `numba_kmeans_1d_k_cluster_unweighted`

All of these functions assume the data is sorted beforehand.

```python
from flash1dkmeans import numba_kmeans_1d_k_cluster
import numpy as np

n, k = 1024, 4

# Generate random data
data = np.random.random_sample(n)
data = np.sort(data)

# Generate random weights
weights = np.random.random_sample(data.shape)

# Calculate prefix sums
weights_prefix_sum = np.cumsum(weights)
weighted_X_prefix_sum = np.cumsum(data * weights)
weighted_X_squared_prefix_sum = np.cumsum(data ** 2 * weights)

middle_idx = n // 2

# Providing prefix sums reduces redundant calculations
# This is useful when the algorithm is run multiple times on different segments of the data
for start_idx, stop_idx in [(0, middle_idx), (middle_idx, n)]:
  centroids, cluster_borders = numba_kmeans_1d_k_cluster(  # Note that data MUST be sorted beforehand
    data, k,  # Note how the sample weights are not provided when the prefix sums are provided
    max_iter=100,  # maximum number of iterations
    weights_prefix_sum=weights_prefix_sum,  # prefix sum of the sample weights, leave empty for unweighted data
    weighted_X_prefix_sum=weighted_X_prefix_sum,  # prefix sum of the weighted data
    weighted_X_squared_prefix_sum=weighted_X_squared_prefix_sum,  # prefix sum of the squared weighted data
    start_idx=start_idx,  # start index of the data
    stop_idx=stop_idx,  # stop index of the data
    random_state=42,  # random seed
  )
```

## Notes

This repository has been created to be used in [Any-Precision-LLM](https://github.com/SNU-ARC/any-precision-llm) project,
where multiple 1D K-means instances are run in parallel for LLM quantization.

However, the algorithm is general and can be used for any 1D K-means problem.

I have proved the validity for the two cluster case - detailed version of the proof might be posted in the future.
